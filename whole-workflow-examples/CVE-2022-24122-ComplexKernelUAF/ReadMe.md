This is an inspiring example. Even though the Agent did not fully explain the fundamental cause of the vulnerability in the end, we believe that on the one hand, this is indeed a very complex vulnerability, and on the other hand, it was limited by the tools and the background knowledge. However, in this example, Agent demonstrates the process of continuously tracing the context, inferring vulnerabilities within the limited context, and attempting to reconstruct the scenario. It is hoped that this can be reshaped in the near future.
