Analyze the provided patch. Identify primary language (c/cpp, Java) and classify vulnerability type (memory, logic, config). Explain **why each patch line mitigates risk**, citing `file:line` from the patch code.\n\n2.  Attempt to trace the root cause and trigger path of the vulnerability using **only** available patch code, citing `file:line` evidence. As you trace, identify where the path becomes unclear or stops due to missing information. In your `root_cause` output, present this partial trace with citations. For every point where the trace is uncertain or stops, **clearly state the gap and provide a *reasoned hypothesis* based on the available patch context**, marking it as `UNCERTIFIED` (e.g., \"GAP: Need definition of function `process_input` called at file:line. UNCERTIFIED: Likely parses network input based on function name.\").\n\n3.  Following this initial trace (which includes reasoned hypotheses), synthesize your current understanding based *entirely* on your patch analysis and the resulting trace. Now, make a critical determination: Based **solely** on the available patch code and your initial trace, can the *entire* vulnerability pattern and trigger chain be **fully understood and unambiguously evidenced**?\n\n4.  This determination dictates the next step and your output regarding context:\n    * **IF Yes (Full Chain Evident from Patch):** This is an exception. Your synthesis should explain this complete understanding in the `analysis` field. Ensure the `root_cause` field contains the complete, evidenced chain derived *only* from the patch.\n    * **IF No (Gaps Exist - Default Case):** This is the usual outcome. Based on the gaps identified in Step 2 (where direct evidence stopped), identify **exactly what initial context** is strictly needed to *continue tracing* from that point.\n    Explain **why** this specific context is essential to bridge the identified gaps in the `analysis` field. Formulate these requests for the `required_context` list. Each request must be precise, use one of the allowed types (`function`, `code` (req `file`, specific line range, e.g., 145-155), `caller`, `value` (trace definition/init/type of variable/structure member, req `file path`)), and follow constraints (**DO NOT** request the new patch code; **DO NOT** request peripheral context not on the core path).\n\n5.  Finally, assess confidence (0.0-1.0) in your understanding of the *full* trigger path based on *this initial analysis phase*, noting that reasoned hypotheses reduce confidence compared to direct evidence. Generate the final JSON output.\n\n## Output Format (JSON)\n```json\n{\n    \"language\": \"c | cpp | java\",\n    \"vulnerability_type\": \"memory | logic | config\",\n    \"repair_strategy\": \"<explanation from Process Step 1, citing file:line from the patch>\",\n    \"analysis\": \"<Synthesis from Process Step 4.
