  "commit_msg": "powerpc/tm: Check for already reclaimed tasks\n\nCurrently we can hit a scenario where we'll tm_reclaim() twice.  This\nresults in a TM bad thing exception because the second reclaim occurs\nwhen not in suspend mode.\n\nThe scenario in which this can happen is the following.  We attempt to\ndeliver a signal to userspace.  To do this we need obtain the stack\npointer to write the signal context.  To get this stack pointer we\nmust tm_reclaim() in case we need to use the checkpointed stack\npointer (see get_tm_stackpointer()).  Normally we'd then return\ndirectly to userspace to deliver the signal without going through\n__switch_to().\n\nUnfortunatley, if at this point we get an error (such as a bad\nuserspace stack pointer), we need to exit the process.  The exit will\nresult in a __switch_to().  __switch_to() will attempt to save the\nprocess state which results in another tm_reclaim().  This\ntm_reclaim() now causes a TM Bad Thing exception as this state has\nalready been saved and the processor is no longer in TM suspend mode.\nWhee!\n\nThis patch checks the state of the MSR to ensure we are TM suspended\nbefore we attempt the tm_reclaim().  If we've already saved the state\naway, we should no longer be in TM suspend mode.  This has the\nadditional advantage of checking for a potential TM Bad Thing\nexception.\n\nFound using syscall fuzzer.\n\nFixes: fb09692e71f1 (\"powerpc: Add reclaim and recheckpoint functions for context switching transactional memory processes\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v3.9+\nSigned-off-by: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>\nSigned-off-by: Michael Ellerman <mpe@ellerman.id.au>",
