      "This doesn't actually fix all the potential memleaks yet. e.g. in kill_TCP_server the TCP_Secure_Connections aren't wiped, so there could be unfreed priority queues. Similarly in realloc_connection. I'm also worried about the potential for double frees. This is going to take some care... is there anyone who's actually familiar with TCP_server.c and wouldn't mind helping out?",
      "@zugz what do you mean by \"non-verbally\"? How exactly did he communicate? Was it by taking down 3/4 of bootstrap nodes? Because if so, then that's a rather malicious way of communicating and tox-rs ain't no friend.",

      "OK, this is ready for (re)review now, and I believe it now fully seals this source of memleaks rather than just dealing with the case exploited in #1214. There wasn't nearly as much further work as I was fearing in my previous comment.\r\n\r\nA word on my methodology here: I haven't actually grokked the entirety of TCP_server.c; rather, I searched for \"TCP_Secure_Connection\" and followed up on each hit. I don't see that I could be missing anything. Also, with these latest changes asan now passes on #1215 - and asan's previous failure there was what directly led me to finding the memleak, which incidentally I think we can read as a win for our testing regime!\r\n\r\nAnyway, please review carefully.",
