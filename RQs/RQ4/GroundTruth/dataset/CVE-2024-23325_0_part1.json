It would still be good to copy the links to the CVEs into the PR description so that when we see the commit in git history it has the relevant context.",

Feel free to get a second opinion from another maintainer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Your PR description should have details on what the PR does.

      "I believe [the commit](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/32300/commits/f1cd344edb2775eef8b9d456c76e4a249f1bac8f) to sanitize the proxy protocol values seems wrong. The [sanitizeUtf8String](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/6231a648424d6ae5209d5346960e825a216f95fa/source/common/protobuf/yaml_utility.cc#L341) function used modifies the bytes in a non-recoverable way, but the actual value isn't always meant to be a valid utf8 string. I believe the [proxy protocol spec](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) allows for this.\r\n\r\nMaterially, Google's private service connect (PSC) feature encodes a TLV value as a binary encoded int64. With this commit there's no way to recover the original value in most cases. Example value bytes that should be a valid PSC id\r\n`00 22 6b cf 0a 00 00 02` (decodes to `9688686178336770`)\r\n\r\nI think either using set_bytes within `ProtobufWkt::Value` (which doesn't seem to exist today) or escaping the bad bytes in a reverseable way would be necessary.",
      "I think this happened because Envoy is using a protobuf string for both moving data around internally, and sending protobufs flattened over the network. I agree this is an unintended change in behavior. I'm not sure what the best way to fix this is. Can you open an issue for this @fedya-at-db ?",
