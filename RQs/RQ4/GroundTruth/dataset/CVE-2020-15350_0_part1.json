      "### Contribution description\r\n\r\n- Cherry-picked [@mjurczak fix](https://github.com/mjurczak/RIOT/commit/d27b048c28ceb1e3d0e0b06faa2f77965b7784d9) for the decode buffer size estimation (which could result in a buffer overflow of up to one byte note being catched)\r\n- Made using the API less pain by accepting `void` pointers for buffers (non-breaking change, as `unsigned char *` is implicitly casted to `void *`)\r\n- Cleaned up the unit test to fix basic code quality issued\r\n- Added a unit test to check the `base64_estimate_{de,en}code_size()`\r\n- Added a benchmark for base64 (this will come in useful to review a follow up PR)\r\n\r\n### Testing procedure\r\n\r\nThe unit tests should no detect an issue in `base64_estimate_{de,en}code_size()`\r\n\r\n### Issues/PRs references\r\n\r\nNone",

(Or two raw numbers, one for encode and one for decode.) IMO, at least a second benchmark result from the same hardware is needed to have any meaningful information.\r\n\r\nWhat we could do (if we want to run automatic tests), is to feed a database with the raw results to see how performance changes over time. But maybe such considerations should be done independently form this PR and applied later on to all benchmarks.",
