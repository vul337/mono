It seems there are a few third-party files, e.g., skiplist.h, which has a different license with others like defaults.h.

      "all required changes have been placed. but you can see from the previous CI results that this libb64 leads to a lot of compiling failures. To eliminate these failures, I have to slightly revise the code in libb64 by changing `int base64_decode_value(char value_in)` to `signed char base64_decode_value(signed char value_in)`.\r\n\r\nperhaps we need to find another reliable base64 lib. please suggest if more changes are required.",
