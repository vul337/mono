(Or two raw numbers, one for encode and one for decode.) IMO, at least a second benchmark result from the same hardware is needed to have any meaningful information.\r\n\r\nWhat we could do (if we want to run automatic tests), is to feed a database with the raw results to see how performance changes over time. But maybe such considerations should be done independently form this PR and applied later on to all benchmarks.",
