Less\n    memory usage, better readable.",

      "Avoid processing stackswap when stack only contains one element. In this case, print a warning if debug mode is enabled, and return cleanly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes CVE-2017-11733 (fixes #78).\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n* This fix only addresses the null pointer dereference issue. See #78.\r\n* I'm going to update this PR in order to also address the memory leaks issue. I'd suggest to wait before merge.",
      "This PR now addresses various issues regarding `readSInt16`, `readUInt16` and `readSInt32`.\r\n\r\nThese issues haven't been reported as such, but I suspect them to be part of those still open.",
      "I also suggest to un-define `DEBUGSTACK`. You'll find more detailed explanations in the commit message.\r\n\r\nThese three commit are addressing three (more or less) separate issues. If you want, I can squash them into a single one, but I wouldn't recommend it.\r\n\r\nCVE-2017-11733 seems to be completely fixed now.",
      "Should that \"stackswap: can't swap\" warning really be protected by\nDEBUG ?\n\nAnyway, I merged it as-is, thank you!\n"
