Commit message & description are auxiliary.\n  * **Reject every hypothesis or inference** - When evidence is missing, always declare a GAP and request the needed context.\n  * **Tool Restriction** – `required_context` items **must** be of type `function` or `caller` only.\n  * **Stop Condition** – Terminate only when the trigger chain is fully evidenced from the patch; else continue requesting context.\n",
