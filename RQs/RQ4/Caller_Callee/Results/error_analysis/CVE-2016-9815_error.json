Using **all available code context**, build the **complete, evidence-backed root-cause and trigger chain** for the vulnerability.\n\n## INPUTS\n- **Commit Message**: arm32: handle async aborts delivered while at HYP\n\nIf guest generates an asynchronous abort and then traps into HYP\n(by HVC or IRQ) before the abort has been delivered, the hypervisor\ncould not catch it, because the PSTATE.A bit is masked all the time\nin hypervisor. So this asynchronous abort may be slipped to next\nrunning guest with PSTATE.A bit unmasked.\n\nIn order to avoid this, it is necessary to take the abort at HYP, by\nclearing the PSTATE.A bit. In this patch, we unmask the PSTATE.A bit\nto open a window to catch guest-generated asynchronous abort in all\nGuest -> HYP switch paths. If we caught such asynchronous abort in\nchecking window, the HYP data abort exception will be triggered and\nthe abort source guest will be crashed.\n\nThis is part of XSA-201.\n\nSigned-off-by: Wei Chen <Wei.Chen@arm.com>\nReviewed-by: Julien Grall <julien.grall@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Stefano Stabellini <sstabellini@kernel.org>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: Xen through 4.7.x allows local ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host panic) by sending an asynchronous abort.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -64,4 +64,7 @@\\n asmlinkage void do_trap_data_abort(struct cpu_user_regs *regs)\\n {\\n-    do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n+    if ( VABORT_GEN_BY_GUEST(regs) )\\n+        do_trap_guest_error(regs);\\n+    else\\n+        do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/arch/arm/arm32/traps.c'}, {'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort_guest', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -2511,6 +2511,15 @@\\n     mmio_info_t info;\\n     uint8_t fsc = hsr.dabt.dfsc & ~FSC_LL_MASK;\\n     mfn_t mfn;\\n+\\n+    /*\\n+     * If this bit has been set, it means that this data abort is caused\\n+     * by a guest external abort.

Using **all available code context**, build the **complete, evidence-backed root-cause and trigger chain** for the vulnerability.\n\n## INPUTS\n- **Commit Message**: arm32: handle async aborts delivered while at HYP\n\nIf guest generates an asynchronous abort and then traps into HYP\n(by HVC or IRQ) before the abort has been delivered, the hypervisor\ncould not catch it, because the PSTATE.A bit is masked all the time\nin hypervisor. So this asynchronous abort may be slipped to next\nrunning guest with PSTATE.A bit unmasked.\n\nIn order to avoid this, it is necessary to take the abort at HYP, by\nclearing the PSTATE.A bit. In this patch, we unmask the PSTATE.A bit\nto open a window to catch guest-generated asynchronous abort in all\nGuest -> HYP switch paths. If we caught such asynchronous abort in\nchecking window, the HYP data abort exception will be triggered and\nthe abort source guest will be crashed.\n\nThis is part of XSA-201.\n\nSigned-off-by: Wei Chen <Wei.Chen@arm.com>\nReviewed-by: Julien Grall <julien.grall@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Stefano Stabellini <sstabellini@kernel.org>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: Xen through 4.7.x allows local ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host panic) by sending an asynchronous abort.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -64,4 +64,7 @@\\n asmlinkage void do_trap_data_abort(struct cpu_user_regs *regs)\\n {\\n-    do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n+    if ( VABORT_GEN_BY_GUEST(regs) )\\n+        do_trap_guest_error(regs);\\n+    else\\n+        do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/arch/arm/arm32/traps.c'}, {'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort_guest', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -2511,6 +2511,15 @@\\n     mmio_info_t info;\\n     uint8_t fsc = hsr.dabt.dfsc & ~FSC_LL_MASK;\\n     mfn_t mfn;\\n+\\n+    /*\\n+     * If this bit has been set, it means that this data abort is caused\\n+     * by a guest external abort.

Using **all available code context**, build the **complete, evidence-backed root-cause and trigger chain** for the vulnerability.\n\n## INPUTS\n- **Commit Message**: arm32: handle async aborts delivered while at HYP\n\nIf guest generates an asynchronous abort and then traps into HYP\n(by HVC or IRQ) before the abort has been delivered, the hypervisor\ncould not catch it, because the PSTATE.A bit is masked all the time\nin hypervisor. So this asynchronous abort may be slipped to next\nrunning guest with PSTATE.A bit unmasked.\n\nIn order to avoid this, it is necessary to take the abort at HYP, by\nclearing the PSTATE.A bit. In this patch, we unmask the PSTATE.A bit\nto open a window to catch guest-generated asynchronous abort in all\nGuest -> HYP switch paths. If we caught such asynchronous abort in\nchecking window, the HYP data abort exception will be triggered and\nthe abort source guest will be crashed.\n\nThis is part of XSA-201.\n\nSigned-off-by: Wei Chen <Wei.Chen@arm.com>\nReviewed-by: Julien Grall <julien.grall@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Stefano Stabellini <sstabellini@kernel.org>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: Xen through 4.7.x allows local ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host panic) by sending an asynchronous abort.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -64,4 +64,7 @@\\n asmlinkage void do_trap_data_abort(struct cpu_user_regs *regs)\\n {\\n-    do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n+    if ( VABORT_GEN_BY_GUEST(regs) )\\n+        do_trap_guest_error(regs);\\n+    else\\n+        do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/arch/arm/arm32/traps.c'}, {'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort_guest', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -2511,6 +2511,15 @@\\n     mmio_info_t info;\\n     uint8_t fsc = hsr.dabt.dfsc & ~FSC_LL_MASK;\\n     mfn_t mfn;\\n+\\n+    /*\\n+     * If this bit has been set, it means that this data abort is caused\\n+     * by a guest external abort.

So this asynchronous abort may be slipped to next\nrunning guest with PSTATE.A bit unmasked.\n\nIn order to avoid this, it is necessary to take the abort at HYP, by\nclearing the PSTATE.A bit. In this patch, we unmask the PSTATE.A bit\nto open a window to catch guest-generated asynchronous abort in all\nGuest -> HYP switch paths. If we caught such asynchronous abort in\nchecking window, the HYP data abort exception will be triggered and\nthe abort source guest will be crashed.\n\nThis is part of XSA-201.\n\nSigned-off-by: Wei Chen <Wei.Chen@arm.com>\nReviewed-by: Julien Grall <julien.grall@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Stefano Stabellini <sstabellini@kernel.org>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: Xen through 4.7.x allows local ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host panic) by sending an asynchronous abort.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -64,4 +64,7 @@\\n asmlinkage void do_trap_data_abort(struct cpu_user_regs *regs)\\n {\\n-    do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n+    if ( VABORT_GEN_BY_GUEST(regs) )\\n+        do_trap_guest_error(regs);\\n+    else\\n+        do_unexpected_trap(\"Data Abort\", regs);\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/arch/arm/arm32/traps.c'}, {'func_name': 'do_trap_data_abort_guest', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -2511,6 +2511,15 @@\\n     mmio_info_t info;\\n     uint8_t fsc = hsr.dabt.dfsc & ~FSC_LL_MASK;\\n     mfn_t mfn;\\n+\\n+    /*\\n+     * If this bit has been set, it means that this data abort is caused\\n+     * by a guest external abort.

Commit message & description are auxiliary.\n  * **Reject every hypothesis or inference** - When evidence is missing, always declare a GAP and request the needed context.\n  * **Tool Restriction** – `required_context` items **must** be of type `function` or `caller` only.\n  * **Stop Condition** – Terminate only when the trigger chain is fully evidenced from the patch; else continue requesting context.\n",
