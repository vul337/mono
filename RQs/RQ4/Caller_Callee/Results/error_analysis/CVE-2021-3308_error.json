An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'arch_pci_clean_pirqs', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1072,18 +1072,8 @@\\n     hvm_irq_dpci = domain_get_irq_dpci(d);\\n     if ( hvm_irq_dpci != NULL )\\n     {\\n-        int ret = 0;\\n+        int ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n \\n-        if ( hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci )\\n-        {\\n-            if ( pt_pirq_softirq_active(hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci) )\\n-                 ret = -ERESTART;\\n-            else\\n-                 hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci = NULL;\\n-        }\\n-\\n-        if ( !ret )\\n-            ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n         if ( ret )\\n         {\\n             spin_unlock(&d->event_lock);', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}, {'func_name': 'pci_clean_dpci_irq', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1036,6 +1036,10 @@\\n                               struct hvm_pirq_dpci *pirq_dpci, void *arg)\\n {\\n     struct dev_intx_gsi_link *digl, *tmp;\\n+\\n+    if ( !pirq_dpci->flags )\\n+        /* Already processed. */\\n+        return 0;\\n \\n     pirq_guest_unbind(d, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci));\\n \\n@@ -1047,13 +1051,8 @@\\n         list_del(&digl->list);\\n         xfree(digl);\\n     }\\n+    /* Note the pirq is now unbound. */\\n+    pirq_dpci->flags = 0;\\n \\n-    radix_tree_delete(&d->pirq_tree, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci)->pirq);\\n-\\n-    if ( !pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) )\\n-        return 0;\\n-\\n-    domain_get_irq_dpci(d)->pending_pirq_dpci = pirq_dpci;\\n-\\n-    return -ERESTART;\\n+    return pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) ? -ERESTART : 0;\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}]\n- **History Summary (all prior context & analysis)**: [\n  {\n    \"stage\": \"initial\",\n    \"result\": {\n      \"language\": \"c\",\n      \"vulnerability_type\": \"logic\",\n      \"repair_strategy\": \"In pci_clean_dpci_irq (xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c), the patch replaces radix_tree_delete with flag clearing (pirq_dpci->flags = 0) to retain pirqs in the domain tree while signaling unbound state.

This prevents calling\npirq_guest_unbind multiple times for the same pirq without having to\nremove it from the domain pirq tree.\n\nThis is XSA-360.\n\nFixes: 5b58dad089 ('x86/pass-through: avoid double IRQ unbind during domain cleanup')\nReported-by: Samuel Verschelde <samuel.verschelde@vates.fr>\nSigned-off-by: Roger Pau Monn√© <roger.pau@citrix.com>\nReviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain.

That\ncaused free_domain_pirqs to no longer unmap the pirqs because they\nare gone from the domain pirq tree, thus leaving stale unbound pirqs\nafter domain destruction if the domain had mapped dpci pirqs after\nshutdown.\n\nTake a different approach to fix the original issue, instead of\nremoving the pirq from d->pirq_tree clear the flags of the dpci pirq\nstruct to signal that the pirq is now unbound. This prevents calling\npirq_guest_unbind multiple times for the same pirq without having to\nremove it from the domain pirq tree.\n\nThis is XSA-360.\n\nFixes: 5b58dad089 ('x86/pass-through: avoid double IRQ unbind during domain cleanup')\nReported-by: Samuel Verschelde <samuel.verschelde@vates.fr>\nSigned-off-by: Roger Pau Monn√© <roger.pau@citrix.com>\nReviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'arch_pci_clean_pirqs', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1072,18 +1072,8 @@\\n     hvm_irq_dpci = domain_get_irq_dpci(d);\\n     if ( hvm_irq_dpci != NULL )\\n     {\\n-        int ret = 0;\\n+        int ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n \\n-        if ( hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci )\\n-        {\\n-            if ( pt_pirq_softirq_active(hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci) )\\n-                 ret = -ERESTART;\\n-            else\\n-                 hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci = NULL;\\n-        }\\n-\\n-        if ( !ret )\\n-            ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n         if ( ret )\\n         {\\n             spin_unlock(&d->event_lock);', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}, {'func_name': 'pci_clean_dpci_irq', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1036,6 +1036,10 @@\\n                               struct hvm_pirq_dpci *pirq_dpci, void *arg)\\n {\\n     struct dev_intx_gsi_link *digl, *tmp;\\n+\\n+    if ( !pirq_dpci->flags )\\n+        /* Already processed. */\\n+        return 0;\\n \\n     pirq_guest_unbind(d, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci));\\n \\n@@ -1047,13 +1051,8 @@\\n         list_del(&digl->list);\\n         xfree(digl);\\n     }\\n+    /* Note the pirq is now unbound. */\\n+    pirq_dpci->flags = 0;\\n \\n-    radix_tree_delete(&d->pirq_tree, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci)->pirq);\\n-\\n-    if ( !pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) )\\n-        return 0;\\n-\\n-    domain_get_irq_dpci(d)->pending_pirq_dpci = pirq_dpci;\\n-\\n-    return -ERESTART;\\n+    return pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) ? -ERESTART : 0;\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}]\n- **History Summary (all prior context & analysis)**: [\n  {\n    \"stage\": \"initial\",\n    \"result\": {\n      \"language\": \"c\",\n      \"vulnerability_type\": \"logic\",\n      \"repair_strategy\": \"In pci_clean_dpci_irq (xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c), the patch replaces radix_tree_delete with flag clearing (pirq_dpci->flags = 0) to retain pirqs in the domain tree while signaling unbound state.

That\ncaused free_domain_pirqs to no longer unmap the pirqs because they\nare gone from the domain pirq tree, thus leaving stale unbound pirqs\nafter domain destruction if the domain had mapped dpci pirqs after\nshutdown.\n\nTake a different approach to fix the original issue, instead of\nremoving the pirq from d->pirq_tree clear the flags of the dpci pirq\nstruct to signal that the pirq is now unbound. This prevents calling\npirq_guest_unbind multiple times for the same pirq without having to\nremove it from the domain pirq tree.\n\nThis is XSA-360.\n\nFixes: 5b58dad089 ('x86/pass-through: avoid double IRQ unbind during domain cleanup')\nReported-by: Samuel Verschelde <samuel.verschelde@vates.fr>\nSigned-off-by: Roger Pau Monn√© <roger.pau@citrix.com>\nReviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'arch_pci_clean_pirqs', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1072,18 +1072,8 @@\\n     hvm_irq_dpci = domain_get_irq_dpci(d);\\n     if ( hvm_irq_dpci != NULL )\\n     {\\n-        int ret = 0;\\n+        int ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n \\n-        if ( hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci )\\n-        {\\n-            if ( pt_pirq_softirq_active(hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci) )\\n-                 ret = -ERESTART;\\n-            else\\n-                 hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci = NULL;\\n-        }\\n-\\n-        if ( !ret )\\n-            ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n         if ( ret )\\n         {\\n             spin_unlock(&d->event_lock);', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}, {'func_name': 'pci_clean_dpci_irq', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1036,6 +1036,10 @@\\n                               struct hvm_pirq_dpci *pirq_dpci, void *arg)\\n {\\n     struct dev_intx_gsi_link *digl, *tmp;\\n+\\n+    if ( !pirq_dpci->flags )\\n+        /* Already processed. */\\n+        return 0;\\n \\n     pirq_guest_unbind(d, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci));\\n \\n@@ -1047,13 +1051,8 @@\\n         list_del(&digl->list);\\n         xfree(digl);\\n     }\\n+    /* Note the pirq is now unbound. */\\n+    pirq_dpci->flags = 0;\\n \\n-    radix_tree_delete(&d->pirq_tree, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci)->pirq);\\n-\\n-    if ( !pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) )\\n-        return 0;\\n-\\n-    domain_get_irq_dpci(d)->pending_pirq_dpci = pirq_dpci;\\n-\\n-    return -ERESTART;\\n+    return pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) ? -ERESTART : 0;\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}]\n- **History Summary (all prior context & analysis)**: [\n  {\n    \"stage\": \"initial\",\n    \"result\": {\n      \"language\": \"c\",\n      \"vulnerability_type\": \"logic\",\n      \"repair_strategy\": \"In pci_clean_dpci_irq (xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c), the patch replaces radix_tree_delete with flag clearing (pirq_dpci->flags = 0) to retain pirqs in the domain tree while signaling unbound state.

That\ncaused free_domain_pirqs to no longer unmap the pirqs because they\nare gone from the domain pirq tree, thus leaving stale unbound pirqs\nafter domain destruction if the domain had mapped dpci pirqs after\nshutdown.\n\nTake a different approach to fix the original issue, instead of\nremoving the pirq from d->pirq_tree clear the flags of the dpci pirq\nstruct to signal that the pirq is now unbound. This prevents calling\npirq_guest_unbind multiple times for the same pirq without having to\nremove it from the domain pirq tree.\n\nThis is XSA-360.\n\nFixes: 5b58dad089 ('x86/pass-through: avoid double IRQ unbind during domain cleanup')\nReported-by: Samuel Verschelde <samuel.verschelde@vates.fr>\nSigned-off-by: Roger Pau Monn√© <roger.pau@citrix.com>\nReviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'arch_pci_clean_pirqs', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1072,18 +1072,8 @@\\n     hvm_irq_dpci = domain_get_irq_dpci(d);\\n     if ( hvm_irq_dpci != NULL )\\n     {\\n-        int ret = 0;\\n+        int ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n \\n-        if ( hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci )\\n-        {\\n-            if ( pt_pirq_softirq_active(hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci) )\\n-                 ret = -ERESTART;\\n-            else\\n-                 hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci = NULL;\\n-        }\\n-\\n-        if ( !ret )\\n-            ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n         if ( ret )\\n         {\\n             spin_unlock(&d->event_lock);', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}, {'func_name': 'pci_clean_dpci_irq', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1036,6 +1036,10 @@\\n                               struct hvm_pirq_dpci *pirq_dpci, void *arg)\\n {\\n     struct dev_intx_gsi_link *digl, *tmp;\\n+\\n+    if ( !pirq_dpci->flags )\\n+        /* Already processed. */\\n+        return 0;\\n \\n     pirq_guest_unbind(d, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci));\\n \\n@@ -1047,13 +1051,8 @@\\n         list_del(&digl->list);\\n         xfree(digl);\\n     }\\n+    /* Note the pirq is now unbound. */\\n+    pirq_dpci->flags = 0;\\n \\n-    radix_tree_delete(&d->pirq_tree, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci)->pirq);\\n-\\n-    if ( !pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) )\\n-        return 0;\\n-\\n-    domain_get_irq_dpci(d)->pending_pirq_dpci = pirq_dpci;\\n-\\n-    return -ERESTART;\\n+    return pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) ? -ERESTART : 0;\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}]\n- **History Summary (all prior context & analysis)**: [\n  {\n    \"stage\": \"initial\",\n    \"result\": {\n      \"language\": \"c\",\n      \"vulnerability_type\": \"logic\",\n      \"repair_strategy\": \"In pci_clean_dpci_irq (xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c), the patch replaces radix_tree_delete with flag clearing (pirq_dpci->flags = 0) to retain pirqs in the domain tree while signaling unbound state.

That\ncaused free_domain_pirqs to no longer unmap the pirqs because they\nare gone from the domain pirq tree, thus leaving stale unbound pirqs\nafter domain destruction if the domain had mapped dpci pirqs after\nshutdown.\n\nTake a different approach to fix the original issue, instead of\nremoving the pirq from d->pirq_tree clear the flags of the dpci pirq\nstruct to signal that the pirq is now unbound. This prevents calling\npirq_guest_unbind multiple times for the same pirq without having to\nremove it from the domain pirq tree.\n\nThis is XSA-360.\n\nFixes: 5b58dad089 ('x86/pass-through: avoid double IRQ unbind during domain cleanup')\nReported-by: Samuel Verschelde <samuel.verschelde@vates.fr>\nSigned-off-by: Roger Pau Monn√© <roger.pau@citrix.com>\nReviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'arch_pci_clean_pirqs', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1072,18 +1072,8 @@\\n     hvm_irq_dpci = domain_get_irq_dpci(d);\\n     if ( hvm_irq_dpci != NULL )\\n     {\\n-        int ret = 0;\\n+        int ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n \\n-        if ( hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci )\\n-        {\\n-            if ( pt_pirq_softirq_active(hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci) )\\n-                 ret = -ERESTART;\\n-            else\\n-                 hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci = NULL;\\n-        }\\n-\\n-        if ( !ret )\\n-            ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n         if ( ret )\\n         {\\n             spin_unlock(&d->event_lock);', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}, {'func_name': 'pci_clean_dpci_irq', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1036,6 +1036,10 @@\\n                               struct hvm_pirq_dpci *pirq_dpci, void *arg)\\n {\\n     struct dev_intx_gsi_link *digl, *tmp;\\n+\\n+    if ( !pirq_dpci->flags )\\n+        /* Already processed. */\\n+        return 0;\\n \\n     pirq_guest_unbind(d, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci));\\n \\n@@ -1047,13 +1051,8 @@\\n         list_del(&digl->list);\\n         xfree(digl);\\n     }\\n+    /* Note the pirq is now unbound. */\\n+    pirq_dpci->flags = 0;\\n \\n-    radix_tree_delete(&d->pirq_tree, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci)->pirq);\\n-\\n-    if ( !pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) )\\n-        return 0;\\n-\\n-    domain_get_irq_dpci(d)->pending_pirq_dpci = pirq_dpci;\\n-\\n-    return -ERESTART;\\n+    return pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) ? -ERESTART : 0;\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}]\n- **History Summary (all prior context & analysis)**: [\n  {\n    \"stage\": \"initial\",\n    \"result\": {\n      \"language\": \"c\",\n      \"vulnerability_type\": \"logic\",\n      \"repair_strategy\": \"In pci_clean_dpci_irq (xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c), the patch replaces radix_tree_delete with flag clearing (pirq_dpci->flags = 0) to retain pirqs in the domain tree while signaling unbound state.

That\ncaused free_domain_pirqs to no longer unmap the pirqs because they\nare gone from the domain pirq tree, thus leaving stale unbound pirqs\nafter domain destruction if the domain had mapped dpci pirqs after\nshutdown.\n\nTake a different approach to fix the original issue, instead of\nremoving the pirq from d->pirq_tree clear the flags of the dpci pirq\nstruct to signal that the pirq is now unbound. This prevents calling\npirq_guest_unbind multiple times for the same pirq without having to\nremove it from the domain pirq tree.\n\nThis is XSA-360.\n\nFixes: 5b58dad089 ('x86/pass-through: avoid double IRQ unbind during domain cleanup')\nReported-by: Samuel Verschelde <samuel.verschelde@vates.fr>\nSigned-off-by: Roger Pau Monn√© <roger.pau@citrix.com>\nReviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>\n- **Vulnerability Description**: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.\n- **Patch Code**: [{'func_name': 'arch_pci_clean_pirqs', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1072,18 +1072,8 @@\\n     hvm_irq_dpci = domain_get_irq_dpci(d);\\n     if ( hvm_irq_dpci != NULL )\\n     {\\n-        int ret = 0;\\n+        int ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n \\n-        if ( hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci )\\n-        {\\n-            if ( pt_pirq_softirq_active(hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci) )\\n-                 ret = -ERESTART;\\n-            else\\n-                 hvm_irq_dpci->pending_pirq_dpci = NULL;\\n-        }\\n-\\n-        if ( !ret )\\n-            ret = pt_pirq_iterate(d, pci_clean_dpci_irq, NULL);\\n         if ( ret )\\n         {\\n             spin_unlock(&d->event_lock);', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}, {'func_name': 'pci_clean_dpci_irq', 'patch': '--- func_before\\n+++ func_after\\n@@ -1036,6 +1036,10 @@\\n                               struct hvm_pirq_dpci *pirq_dpci, void *arg)\\n {\\n     struct dev_intx_gsi_link *digl, *tmp;\\n+\\n+    if ( !pirq_dpci->flags )\\n+        /* Already processed. */\\n+        return 0;\\n \\n     pirq_guest_unbind(d, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci));\\n \\n@@ -1047,13 +1051,8 @@\\n         list_del(&digl->list);\\n         xfree(digl);\\n     }\\n+    /* Note the pirq is now unbound. */\\n+    pirq_dpci->flags = 0;\\n \\n-    radix_tree_delete(&d->pirq_tree, dpci_pirq(pirq_dpci)->pirq);\\n-\\n-    if ( !pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) )\\n-        return 0;\\n-\\n-    domain_get_irq_dpci(d)->pending_pirq_dpci = pirq_dpci;\\n-\\n-    return -ERESTART;\\n+    return pt_pirq_softirq_active(pirq_dpci) ? -ERESTART : 0;\\n }', 'file_path': 'xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c'}]\n- **History Summary (all prior context & analysis)**: [\n  {\n    \"stage\": \"initial\",\n    \"result\": {\n      \"language\": \"c\",\n      \"vulnerability_type\": \"logic\",\n      \"repair_strategy\": \"In pci_clean_dpci_irq (xen/drivers/passthrough/x86/hvm.c), the patch replaces radix_tree_delete with flag clearing (pirq_dpci->flags = 0) to retain pirqs in the domain tree while signaling unbound state.
