This allowed a malicious guest to set max_mapped_gfn to a value that would later trigger p2m_get_root_pointer (xen/arch/arm/p2m.c:230-243) to return NULL for a GFN with non-zero top bits. Functions like p2m_get_entry (xen/arch/arm/p2m.c:403-408) assumed the root table was valid if the GFN was <= max_mapped_gfn, leading to a BUG_ON() and DoS.
