The code's behavior is consistent and does not seem to be influenced by external factors that could lead to incorrect actions.\n\nTherefore, my final response is:\n\nNO_VUL",
        "patched_response": "After analyzing the provided code, I did not find any evidence of the CWE-436 vulnerability. \n\nCWE-436 refers to a situation where two products handle inputs or steps differently, leading to incorrect actions based on their perception of each other's state. However, the code provided appears to be a single product's implementation of a TCP stream handling function, and there is no indication of it interacting with another product in a way that would lead to the described vulnerability.\n\nThe code provided is a part of a larger system, likely a network intrusion detection system, and it handles TCP packets and sessions. It checks various conditions and flags, updates session states, and performs actions based on the packet contents. However, all of these actions are internal to the product and do not involve interactions with another product that could lead to the CWE-436 vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code, the response is:\n\nNO_VUL",

The code appears to be a part of a web server (nginx) and is responsible for handling subrequests and copying request headers.\n\nThe `ngx_http_lua_copy_request_headers` function seems to properly iterate over the headers of the parent request and copies them to the subrequest. The `ngx_http_lua_adjust_subrequest` function also appears to correctly handle the request body and headers.\n\nHowever, I do want to note that the code does not seem to perform any validation or sanitization on the request headers or body. This could potentially lead to other vulnerabilities, such as CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers or CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs.\n\nBut, specifically for CWE-444, I did not find any evidence of the code failing to interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in a way that is consistent with how the messages will be processed by the ultimate destination.\n\nTherefore, my final response is:\n\nNO_VUL",

The `ngx_http_lua_adjust_subrequest` function adjusts the subrequest based on the parent request and the specified method, but it does not seem to introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\nTherefore, my final response is:\n\nNO_VUL",
